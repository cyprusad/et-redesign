Redesign of The Economic Times.

The Economic Times is the most widely read financial daily in India with a readership of over 800,000. We saw an opportunity to reimagine its digital version. What we came up with is a design that not only brings the website up to a 2013 feel, but one that sets new standards in what digital publications could look like. The redesign concept follows a minimalistic, responsive layout. It also recreates the salmon pink paper feel - signature of financial publications - while attempting to mimic the European design aesthetic of the 70s.
